# reverse-game-of-life

Solving reverse game of life using genetic algorithm!

## Model 
1. Training MLP(Predicting one step past of conway game board)'s weight and bias using genetic algorithm
2. Find the direct starting board of conway game of life using Genetic algorithm

### 1. Attempt to train MLP weight and bias using Genetic algorithm 

Mostly Genetic algorithm is used to find the best MLP topology.
At here we are trying to to train the weight and bias of MLP using the Genetic Algorithm.

**CURRENT STATUS : DARK FUTURE / VERY UNPROMISING**

### 2. Find the start board with genetic algorithm

**CURRENT STATUS : Not Implemented but coming soon!**
